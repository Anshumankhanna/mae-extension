# MAE (Extension): Make Applying Easy

## Purpose

This project is aimed at providing features that make applying to jobs easier.

## Problem

- When applying to jobs we have many challenges when trying to applying jobs that arise due to the variety of jobs portals that we have to work with.
- There is a huge variety of fields.
- It is not everytime that a job portal allows you to fill application using your resume.
- Even when some portal allows you to fill using your resume there are a whole lot of useless questions after that which you to fill manually. And mostly resume fill just fails in certain fields.

It would be so much better if there was one application that you can trust to always fill the page that you are on with 100% accuracy as that application knows you all the time.

## Solution

- This is what we are working on.
